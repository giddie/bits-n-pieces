h1. README

This script is based upon the one I found on "this site":http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/961.  However, that script has several issues that I wanted to resolve:

# It choked if iTerm was running but had no open terminals.
# It would open a spurious new tab in iTerm wasn't running before it was called.

This modified version fixes those issues, and seems to work well for me.
